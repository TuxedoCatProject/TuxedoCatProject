Hello Hoomans,

My name is TuxCat from Cat Universe and I am coming to your world to help free yourselves from chieftains of world economy. I see hoomans struggle with financial issues causing mental, physical and psychological stress throughout their life. Luckily, I have chosen hoomans of Earth and I have made my mission to create a powerhouse in RWA sector of blockchain projects.

​It has come to my attention that few hoomans have taken control over economy of Earth and taking all the profit for themselves while remaining hoomans struggling to live. I believe that this trend can be broken by manufacturing/selling products for hoomans and share the revenue with them.

​To make this scenario understandable in a simpler way, I can provide an example. Hoomans use something called toothpaste, a sticky, foaming product. It has become a daily routine for them to use it in the morning. Well, I checked its background and found that it has a market size of $30 billion USD and increasing. Also found something interesting that less than 5 companies own maximum share in this sector. So, if there’s a toothpaste manufactured/marketed by TUX community, and manages to achieve tiny 0.1% of that market it could generate significant amount of revenue for the community. 

​While thinking of how to do revenue sharing, I found blockchain technology could help resolving the issues regarding community member's share holding for revenue distribution; thus, TUX token was created. Community members holding TUX tokens can claim their revenue share depending on their percentage of TUX token holdings.

How we plan to work:


Marketing Wallet > Investment > Revenue Generation > Distribution to Holders
